Welcome! The Interpreter Command suite provides a way to create `Domain-specific Languages <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language>`_ 
to control any aspect of a robot's behaviour. Ostensibly, this can be used to generate autonomous routines on-the-fly,
but this can be used anywhere that complex behaviours are useful.

This software is designed to be used with `RobotPy <https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and 
`WPILib <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html>`_. Use outside of these contexts probably won't work.

Use the navigation tree on the left to read the docs.

Let's start by :doc:`installing the package <installation>`!
